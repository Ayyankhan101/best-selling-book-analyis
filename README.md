### 1. Descriptive Statistics

| Metric | Rating | Price (₹) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean** | 4.46 | 330.67 |
| **Median** | 4.50 | 299.00 |
| **Std Dev** | 0.23 | 205.67 |
| **Min** | 3.60 | 88.00 |
| **Max** | 4.80 | 1357.00 |
| **Count** | 50 | 50 |

**Interpretation:**

*   **Ratings are consistently high:** The average rating is **4.46**, with a very small standard deviation. This suggests that to be a bestseller, a book generally needs to be very well-received, with most ratings clustered between **4.23 and 4.69** (within one standard deviation).
*   **Price varies significantly:** The price of bestsellers has a wide range, from a budget-friendly **₹88** to a premium **₹1357**. The standard deviation is large, indicating that price is not a uniform factor for success. The median price of **₹299** is lower than the average, suggesting that some high-priced books are skewing the average upwards.

### 2. Top Authors by Bestseller Count

| Author Name | Number of Bestsellers |
| :--- | :--- |
| Wonder House Books | 10 |
| Maple Press | 4 |
| Joseph Murphy | 3 |
| Dale Carnegie | 3 |
| Sudha Murty | 3 |
| MTG Editorial Board | 3 |
| Gagan Pratap Sir | 2 |
| Nikhil Gupta | 2 |
| James Clear | 2 |
| Francesc Miralles | 2 |

**Interpretation:**

*   **"Wonder House Books" Dominates:** This author or publisher has a remarkable **10 bestsellers** in this list, suggesting they have a strong focus on producing popular, accessible content, likely for children, as indicated by some of the titles we saw earlier.
*   **Self-Help and Education are Prominent:** Authors like Joseph Murphy, Dale Carnegie, and various educational publishers (MTG, Gagan Pratap Sir) feature multiple times. This points to a strong market for self-improvement and academic books.

### 3. Visual Analysis

*(Based on the generated plots)*

*   **Price Distribution (Histogram):** The price distribution is **right-skewed**. A large number of bestsellers are concentrated in the lower price range (likely under ₹400), with a "long tail" of fewer, more expensive books. This reinforces the idea that while high-priced books can be bestsellers, the bulk of top-selling books are more affordably priced.

*   **Rating Distribution (Histogram):** The ratings are **left-skewed**, with a very high concentration of books rated 4.4 and above. It's a very tight distribution, confirming that high ratings are a near-universal trait of bestsellers in this dataset. A rating below 4.0 is a clear outlier.

*   **Price vs. Rating (Scatter Plot):** The scatter plot shows **no clear correlation between price and rating**. We can see high-rated books at all price points. A book's quality (as measured by rating) does not seem to be dependent on its price. You can have an excellent, highly-rated book for a low price, and a similarly rated book at a much higher price.

### Overall Conclusion & Next Steps

This EDA provides a clear picture of the current bestsellers on Amazon. The market is dominated by **highly-rated, affordably priced books**, with a strong emphasis on **children's books, self-help, and education**.

From here, we could move on to more advanced analysis, such as:

*   **NLP on Book Titles:** To automatically categorize books into genres and see which genres are most popular.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** To try and predict a book's rating based on its price and author, or to identify features that are most predictive of a high rating.
